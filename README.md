# SAITAMA QUANTUM RESISTANT PRE-SALE PROTOCOL
The first Quantum-Resistant Decentralized Pre-sale Protocol, empowering liquidity within the QRL ecosystem.

**Simple Summary**
The first Quantum-Resistant Decentralized Pre-sale Protocol, powering all liquidity around the QRL ecosystem.

**Abstract**
This protocol serves as the first quantum-resistant decentralized presale platform within the QRL ecosystem. It facilitates liquidity addition in the form of QRL tokens while enabling developers, creators, and artists to fund their projects by selling their assets on the only quantum-resistant layer in the market.

With the QRL Foundation currently developing the new Zond Beta-Testnet V1 EVM, the network is transitioning from PoW to PoS, introducing the [Zond Virtual Machine (ZVM)](https://test-zond.theqrl.org/) to support smart contracts and DeFi protocols. This upgrade strengthens the ecosystem's quantum resistance, addressing the imminent threat posed by advancements in quantum computing, such as [Microsoft's Majorana 1 chip with a power of quantum computation](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microsofts-majorana-1-chip-carves-new-path-for-quantum-computing/) of 8 qubits.

As quantum computers advance, the security of traditional ECDSA-based wallets becomes increasingly vulnerable. Our project aims to be the first quantum-resistant decentralized pre-sale protocol, launching alongside the Zond Mainnet with an address space that is post-quantum secure based on XMSS. This will provide a secure and future-proof platform for developers, creators, and artists to raise funds by selling their ZRC-20 tokens on the only quantum-resistant blockchain, ensuring the longevity and security of their assets.

**Motivation**
The necessity of a quantum-resistant decentralized presale protocol is paramount in ensuring secure and sustainable fundraising mechanisms. By leveraging the QRL ecosystem and its forthcoming Zond upgrade, this protocol enhances decentralization and provides a trustless funding avenue for innovators.

**Project Outline**
The Quantum-Resistant Decentralized Pre-sale Protocol aims to provide a secure and decentralized platform for fundraising within the QRL ecosystem. The project is designed to facilitate the sale of ERC-20 tokens in a quantum-resistant environment, ensuring that investors and project creators can participate without the risk posed by evolving quantum computing threats.

- **Purpose:**
  - Enable developers, creators, and artists to raise funds by selling their assets in a quantum-secure ecosystem.
  - Strengthen the QRL ecosystem by increasing liquidity and participation in decentralized finance (DeFi).
  - Establish a sustainable, transparent, and permissionless presale model resistant to quantum attacks.

- **Scope:**
  - Development of a smart contract-based presale platform utilizing the Zond Virtual Machine (ZVM).
  - Integration with QRLâ€™s quantum-resistant blockchain to ensure the security of raised funds and investor contributions.
  - Creation of a user-friendly interface for seamless participation in presales.
  - Implementation of governance mechanisms to allow community-driven improvements and security enhancements.

- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - A fully functional quantum-resistant presale protocol ready for deployment upon Zond Mainnet launch.
  - Increased adoption of QRL-based smart contracts and DeFi applications.
  - Enhanced security and trust for blockchain fundraising by eliminating vulnerabilities associated with traditional cryptographic models.
  - A flourishing ecosystem where developers, artists, and creators can confidently launch their projects knowing that the infrastructure is built to withstand future quantum advancements.

- **Presale Mechanism**

  **Tier-Based Presale without Deadline**

  - **Overview**
    The tier-based presale mechanism is designed to incentivize early participation and ensure a structured token distribution process. The model supports
    predictable and scalable token sales while maintaining market-driven flexibility.

  - **Data-Tech**
    - Number of Tiers: Defined by the user
    - Allocation per Tier: Defined by the user
    - Rate per Sale Increase: Defined by the user
   
  - **Smart Contract Core**
  
    - Factory.sol
  
    - TierPresale.sol
  
    - Vesting.sol
  
  
  - **Mechanism Explanation**
    The presale operates on a tier-based structure:
    - Each tier concludes when all tokens allocated to that tier are sold.
    - The token price increases by a user-defined rate upon the completion of each tier, encouraging prompt investment and early participation.
    - The allocation and pricing mechanism ensures fair and consistent token distribution across all tiers, adapting to market interest and demand.

  - **Advantages**
    - Creates urgency for investors as prices increase as soon as a tier is completed.
    - The time per tier depends on market interest and demand.

  - **Disadvantages**
    - Potential for slower sales if initial interest is low.

**Fee Mechanism**
The protocol uses a fee mechanism to self-maintain its operations. All transactions on the protocol have a cost associated of 2%.


**Roadmap, Timeline, and Budget**
A structured plan outlining the project's milestones, estimated completion dates, and associated budget requirements.

**Ecosystem Benefits**
This protocol aligns with the Foundation's aims by reinforcing the QRL ecosystem, promoting decentralization, and serving the public good. It fosters innovation by offering a secure and quantum-resistant fundraising platform for various stakeholders.
