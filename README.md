# SAITAMA QUANTUM RESISTANT PRE-SALE PROTOCOL
The first Quantum-Resistant Decentralized Pre-sale Protocol, empowering liquidity within the QRL ecosystem.

**Simple Summary**
The first Quantum-Resistant Decentralized Pre-sale Protocol, powering all liquidity around the QRL ecosystem.

**Abstract**
This protocol serves as the first quantum-resistant decentralized presale platform within the QRL ecosystem. It facilitates liquidity addition in the form of QRL tokens while enabling developers, creators, and artists to fund their projects by selling their assets on the only quantum-resistant layer in the market.

With the QRL Foundation currently developing the new Zond Beta-Testnet V1 EVM, the network is transitioning from PoW to PoS, introducing the [Zond Virtual Machine (ZVM)](https://test-zond.theqrl.org/) to support smart contracts and DeFi protocols. This upgrade strengthens the ecosystem's quantum resistance, addressing the imminent threat posed by advancements in quantum computing, such as [Microsoft's Majorana 1 chip with a power of quantum computation](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microsofts-majorana-1-chip-carves-new-path-for-quantum-computing/) of 8 qubits.

As quantum computers advance, the security of traditional ECDSA-based wallets becomes increasingly vulnerable. Our project aims to be the first quantum-resistant decentralized pre-sale protocol, launching alongside the Zond Mainnet with an address space that is post-quantum secure based on XMSS. This will provide a secure and future-proof platform for developers, creators, and artists to raise funds by selling their ZRC-20 tokens on the only quantum-resistant blockchain, ensuring the longevity and security of their assets.

**Motivation**
The necessity of a quantum-resistant decentralized presale protocol is paramount in ensuring secure and sustainable fundraising mechanisms. By leveraging the QRL ecosystem and its forthcoming Zond upgrade, this protocol enhances decentralization and provides a trustless funding avenue for innovators.
